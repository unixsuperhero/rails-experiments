  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Before being a web developer, it is important to understand how the web works.  More specifically, what happens when you "go to" a web page.  That is what this article is about.  At this point, I might write this series of articles much like tcp/ip (specifically the 7-layer model).  In other words, explain how viewing a web page works from a high level view.  Then, with each new article, dig deeper exposing more technical aspects, jargon, etc.</p><h2>Going to a Web Page</h2><p>To go to a web page, the user needs a web browser.  When the browser is open and running, an address (aka url, uri, domain [name]) put into the Address Bar, then the user initiates the process for retrieving the desired page.</p><p>When this happens, the request leaves his computer and contacts a DNS&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Server.  This server takes the web address, specifically the domain name, finds a matching IP Address, then gives the IP Address back.  The most common way of visiting a website is thru its domain name (eg. google.com).  A domain name is an identifier usually composed of common words.  However, we do not communicate with these domain names to retrieve the web page.  We use the IP Address for this.  An IP Address is given to every device that accesses the internet.  It is often the location of another computer.  When we access a web page, we send a request to the ip address, asking for a specific file.  If all is well, the computer sends the file from their IP Address to our IP Address.  When we receive the file, our web browser then converts it into the pretty, colorful documents we call web pages.  The IP Addresses and the process of sending files back and forth, keenly resembles the postal service.  The sender and the receiver both have addresses, a letter can be sent from the sender's address, from post office to post office, until it reaches the receiver's address.</p><p>Let's quickly review the process before I dig a little deeper.</p><ul><li>User opens web browser</li><li>Puts domain name in the Address Bar</li><li>Initiates the request to view the page</li><li>The domain name is converted to an ip address</li><li>Then, the ip address is asked for a "file" or "page"</li><li>With permission, that ip address sends the file to our ip address</li><li>Our web browser reads it, converting it into a formatted page</li><li>Displays the pretty page to us</li></ul><p>Now, hopefully that isn't hard to follow.  We can take some of these explanations and dig into them a little further.</p><p>The ip address where the web page is located, is not what our browser talks to.  Instead, our browser talks <em>through</em> it, to a web server.  There are 2 types of web servers.</p><ol><li><span style="line-height:13.991477012634px;">A physical computer connected to the internet</span></li><li>Software that runs on the physical computer, listening for requests, processing them, and responding with data.</li></ol><p>In this instance we are actually talking about both, at the same time.  However, the physical machine is not interesting.  The software is more complex and interesting.  Over time, web servers have become many things.  However, at the root, a web server takes a request, either retrieves a file, or runs codes, and returns HTML and the many file types (eg. images, stylesheets, javascript files, mp3s, pdfs, etc.) referenced in the HTML to our web browsers.  Our browsers then read the HTML, request any of these other files, and once everything has been downloaded, the page is displayed to us.</p><p>HTML is called a markup language.  For the most part, a markup language is a set of instructions describing how to build a document.  When you think of a document, I'm sure you imagine something like an essay for school, or article in a newspaper.  This is true, but a web page can also be considered a document.  Much like a book, with pictures, HTML describes what words and images are in the document, and where they are positioned.  The other files: images, stylesheets, and javascript files are all enhancements that help make our web experience both enjoyable and interactive.</p><h2>Terms</h2><p>ip address - every machine that connects to the web has an address to identify where data is coming from, and where it is going to.  This address behaves much like a home address.  The process of sending data is nearly identical to sending a letter.</p><p>dns - domain name service (via acronyfinder.com)</p>]]></content:encoded>
