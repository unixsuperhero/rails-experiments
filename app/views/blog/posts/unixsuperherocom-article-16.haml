  %h3 The Home Row is Good. Your Mouse is Evil.
  %p If you are using a Mac with OS X, then you have been blessed with what are known as Emacs [Keyboard] Shortcuts.
  %p This means, that you can do all sorts of things from the homerow inside of a textbox. &nbsp;These include, moving the cursor around without the arrow keys (quickly jump to the beginning or end of the line, move the cursor left/right/up/down, etc.), deleting characters before and after the cursor, etc.
  %p Move the cursor Left, Right, Up, Down.
  %ul
    %li
      %span{:style => "line-height:14px;"} Left = Ctrl + b. (b for back)
    %li Right = Ctrl + f (f for forward)
    %li Up = Ctrl + p (p for previous)
    %li Down Ctrl + n (n for next)
  %p Delete Left, Right, from the cursor to the end of the line.
  %ul
    %li
      %span{:style => "line-height:14px;"} Left = Ctrl + h
    %li Right = Ctrl + d
    %li End of the Line = Ctrl + k
  %p Jump to the Beginning of the Line or the End of the Line.
  %ul
    %li
      %span{:style => "line-height:14px;"} Beginning of the Line = Ctrl + a
    %li End of the Line = Ctrl + e
  %p These are just a few. &nbsp;Iâ€™m sure there are many more. &nbsp;It has been 5 years since I have used EMACS. &nbsp;Do some research and enjoy!
