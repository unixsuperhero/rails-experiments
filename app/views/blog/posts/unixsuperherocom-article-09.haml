  %p I just started vim and I passed in 3 filenames. &nbsp;I do this often. &nbsp;Not only was I trying to open 3 files, I was trying to have them all displayed next to each other in vertical splits. &nbsp;To do this, the options passed to vim are different: vim -O file1 file2 file3;
  %p Anyway, itâ€™s simple to do this once vim has finished loading.
  %pre :bufdo vs
  %p The only issue is the last buffer, #3 in our case, is open twice. &nbsp;Execute :q and you are done.
