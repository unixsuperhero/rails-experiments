  %p Letâ€™s say you have 2 facebook accounts, or 2 gmail accounts.  This is how you login to both of them, at the same time.  Without logging out of the first one.
  %ol
    %li Login to the first account, as usual.
    %li Then, open an Incognito Window.
    %li Login to the second account.
  %p Tada!  Now you are logged into 2 accounts at the same time.
  %p Note: The max is 2 accounts.  All incognito windows share the same session.
  %p
    %sub login to multiple accounts on a site at the same time
